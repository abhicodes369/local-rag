# Local-RAG üçé

Local-RAG is a nutrition analysis and information app that helps you understand the nutritional content of foods and get personalized nutrition advice through a conversational AI assistant.

## Features

- **Nutrition Analysis**: Get detailed nutritional information for thousands of foods
- **Custom Quantity Measurement**: Adjust portion sizes to see scaled nutrition values
- **Visualization**: View nutritional data in easy-to-understand charts
- **AI-Powered Conversation**: Ask nutrition-related questions and get informed responses
- **Search Foods**: Browse through a comprehensive database of common foods

## How It Works

Local-RAG combines structured data retrieval with local AI processing to provide nutrition information without dependency on cloud-based LLMs:

1. **Data Retrieval Layer**: 
   - Uses the USDA FoodData Central API to fetch accurate nutritional data
   - Organizes foods by categories for easy browsing
   - Scales nutrient values based on user-specified quantities

2. **Local AI Processing**:
   - Leverages Ollama to run a smaller, efficient LLM (llama3.2:1b) locally on your machine
   - Processes natural language queries about nutrition
   - Maintains context about previously analyzed foods
   - Generates responses based on scientific nutrition knowledge
   - Works completely offline once set up

3. **Interactive UI**:
   - Built with Streamlit for an intuitive, responsive interface
   - Provides both structured analysis and conversational modes
   - Visualizes nutrition data through interactive charts
   - Maintains conversation history for contextual responses

4. **Contextual Understanding**:
   - Remembers last analyzed food and quantity for follow-up questions
   - Uses system prompts to guide the AI toward nutrition-focused responses
   - Maintains conversation state between interactions

## Tips for Best Results

- Use specific food names for more accurate analysis
- When asking questions, be specific about the food or nutrient you're interested in
- Adjust quantities to match your actual portions
- Try comparing different foods by running multiple analyses

## Troubleshooting

**Error: API Key Invalid**
- Make sure you've correctly added your USDA API key to the code

**No Results Found**
- Try using more general terms (e.g., "apple" instead of "granny smith apple")
- Check your spelling

**Ollama Model Not Loading**
- Ensure Ollama is running in the background
- Verify you've pulled the correct model (`llama3.2:1b`)
